Gofind searches for Go packages via godoc.org.

To install, run

  go get github.com/fzipp/gofind

and put the resulting binary in one of your PATH directories if
$GOPATH/bin isn't already in your PATH.

Usage:

  gofind [<flag> ...] <query> ...

Example:

Search for packages providing encoding and decoding of Apple's plist
data exchange format.

  gofind plist

In case you want automatic paging if the output doesn't fit on one screen,
you can add the following function to your shell profile
(e.g. ~/.bash_profile) on Unix or Linux systems:

  # Automatically page gofind output if it doesn't fit on one screen.
  gofind() {
    command gofind "$@" | less -X -F
  }
